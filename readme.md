Welcome to Secret Text Encryptor! This web application allows you to encrypt or decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher method.

## Overview

- **Encryption and Decryption:** Enter the text, choose the shift, and click the corresponding button to see the results.
- **Shift Value:** Enter a positive shift value to encrypt and a negative value to decrypt.
- **Circular Shift:** Shift is applied in a circular manner, so entering a shift of 26 is the same as entering 0.

## Usage

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gorachand22/Secret-Text-Encryptor.git
